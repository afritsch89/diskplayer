# diskplayer

forked from dinofizz/diskplayer
See his project for README as this Fork only exists for my personal testing and troubleshooting.

Also, if you are looking to set this up please see original or other forks, because there is no guarentee this will work.
Original has 2 issues where it discusses the fix for the "client identified not found" error:
https://github.com/dinofizz/diskplayer/issues/4

Again see his original for an un-bastardized version.

Bigest thing different here is me cheating by draging in python for a setup script...
Mainly to make thing run faster for me on a clean setup.
